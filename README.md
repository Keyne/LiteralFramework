Literal Framework
==================

> Disclaimer:
> The **Literal Framework** is an experimental project for learning purposes **not intended** for production environments.
> We're on the early stages, looking for skilled developers to review the code in order to improve the architecture.
> Feel free to fork the repository and push changes.

Project aim?
------------

Be the first well designed micro-framework for studying purposes.

Why Literal?
------------

We want every and each design decisions to be explained literally, in a such way that even an entry-level programmer
will be able to understand and use the acquired knowledge as an exercise.

Architecture
------------

The current architecture covers the following:

> Not completed yet

- \Literal\Http (Request and Response)
- \Literal\Routing (Route and Route Collections)
- \Literal\View (View resolver and view renderer)
- \Literal\Mvc (Application)
- \Literal\Autoloader (Simple autoloader)
- \Literal\Common (Utils)

Lectures (Documentation)
------------------------

> Bear in mind that the lectures are also **experimental** and its content will change as we improve our skills. We
> aren't a trusted source of knowledge. Hence, you **MUST** confirm what you're reading before making any assertions.
> Everything was created **by students for students**.

The lectures/documentation will be created after the release of the first version.
Each folder of the source code will contain a README file explaining why and how the given component was built.


Examples
--------

We are building a simple CMS called LiteralCMS in order to test the framework.
